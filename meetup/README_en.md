WDT is Colima's developer community. We get together **the last Wednesday of every month** at a different place every time; we usually meet at a local technology company's office space. You can see a list of the previous events in the [`/eventos` folder](https://github.com/OscarSwanros/colima-dev/tree/master/meetup/eventos).

## I'd like to give a talk

It doesn't matter if you're new to the community, have 20 years experience, you're just getting started with programming, or you just want to come talk to us about something you learned last week at your job: **we encourage everyone to come give a talk at WDT.**

If you'd like to give a talk in a future WDT session: 

1. [Create a new issue using the appropriate template](https://github.com/OscarSwanros/colima-dev/issues/new?assignees=OscarSwanros&labels=WDT%3AProposal&template=wdt-talk-proposal.md&title=%5BWDT%5D+Talk+Proposal). Make sure you fill in all the relevant information.
2. Once you file the issue, a member of WDT will be contacting you to ask you questions about your talk, in case there's anything that needs to be ironed out.
3. You'll be notified about the WDT session your talk has been accepted for (the appropriate label will be added to your issue). You can also get an overview of the general status [here](https://github.com/OscarSwanros/colima-dev/projects/1).
4. Create your presentation. If you'd like to get some help with your content, or you'd like to get early feedback to make sure you ace your presentation, ping [Oscar Swanros](https://github.com/OscarSwanros/colima-dev/tree/master/dir#directorio). 

Also ping if you're not familiar with GitHub, and he'll assist you to make sure your proposal is submitted and reviewed. You can also ping WDT in our social media profiles directly.

## Guidelines

We welcome all and any contributions that help our efforts to grow the community, but we do ask you to be mindful of the following guidelines when presenting at WDT:

1. **Aim for your talk to last no longer than 20 minutes.** Remember that the WDT sessions happen on Wednesdays nights, which means that the majority of attendees are there after a full day of work or study. We'd like to be respectful of everyone's time.
2. **Keep in mind that WDT attendees are students and professionals.** Do not assume that everyone you'll be presenting to know the full context of what you're talking about. Take some time to go over the basics to make sure everyone gets the most out of your presentation.
3. **Do not include vulgar, sexist, or racist jokes in your presentation.** Consider this a hard rule. We're committed to keeping WDT a safe and inclusive space for everyone.
